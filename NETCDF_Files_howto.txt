## What software can i use to read or convert NETCDF data?

The Python programming language can access netCDF files with the PyNIO[13] module 
(which also facilitates access to a variety of other data formats). 
netCDF files can also be read with the Python module netCDF4-python,[14] and into a pandas-like DataFrame with the xarray module.[15]

Note for example:

JSON format with the ncdump-json utility
Josep Llodr√† has developed a program to output the contents of a netCDF-3 or netCDF-4 file in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 
It is based on Unidata's NCDUMP utility, and it keeps the original ncdump functionality, 
unless the "-j" option is used to specify JSON output.
The program and source are available from https://github.com/jllodra/ncdump-json .
